# Tested on
    1. Kali Linux 4.9
    2. Python 2.7.13 (I do not use Python 3.x because of compatibility issues)
    3. Note that Kali Linux has System-Level Root. That means it installs in the /root/Documents directory instead of /home/user/Documents. You may need to change to superuser if you see "permission denied errors". In order to do this, type...
            "sudo su"
            Enter your credentials
            Then run the setup again
            "python setup.py"
